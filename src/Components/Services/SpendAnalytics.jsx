                                PiLog Spend Analytics is the process of collecting spend data from
                                all purchasing sources and systems, cleansing the data, categorizing the
                                data and analyzing it for the purpose of understanding spending trends and
                                identifying saving opportunities. The data included in the spend analytics
                                might include purchasing data, payment data, credit card data and P-card spend data.

                                useful for sourcing professionals but also for management and budget owners.
